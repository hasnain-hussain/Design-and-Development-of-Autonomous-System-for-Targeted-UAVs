# Design and Development of Autonomous System for Targeted UAVs
I designed and developed a highly cost-effective autonomous guidance system for a target/decoy unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used in military applications, in a project funded by Technia 3M, a leading American company. By eliminating non-value-added activities and fully automating mission execution, I reduced typical market costs from $500-$10,000 to just $150. I conducted comprehensive research on autopilot and navigation systems, integrating GPS-based autonomous take-off, landing, and waypoint navigation. I assembled and integrated hardware components such as flight controllers and sensors to ensure seamless operation, and performed Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations to validate system performance. Collaborating closely with my team, I refined the UAVâ€™s design, optimizing its aerodynamics, electronics, and control algorithms. I also led real-world flight tests, managing the entire project lifecycle from component selection to hardware assembly and software integration, ensuring timely achievement of project goals.
